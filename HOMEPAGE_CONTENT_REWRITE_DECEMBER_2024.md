## Homepage Structure Changes

### OLD HOMEPAGE ISSUES:

- Community impact and rural West Texas context

### ✅ SERVICES PAGES
**Focus**: Detailed service offerings and pricing

- Three core pillars clearly defined
- Commercial vs. residential pricing differentiated

### ✅ GOVERNMENT PAGE
**Focus**: Federal contracting credentials and capabilities
- **Kept as-is** - Already excellent government-focused content
- SAM.gov credentials prominently displayed
