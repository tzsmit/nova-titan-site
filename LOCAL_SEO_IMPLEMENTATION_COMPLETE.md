   - We're filling a massive search gap

2. **Buyer-Intent Focus:**
   - Every page targets commercial buyers actively searching
   - No fluff blog content—pure service pages that convert
   - FAQs answer objections before sales calls

3. **Entity Trust Signals:**
   - SAM.gov registration = credibility
   - Government credentials = authority
   - Lubbock location = local trust
   - Black-owned SDB = diversity advantage

4. **Technical Excellence:**
   - Fast site (existing TailwindCSS + Jekyll optimization)
   - Mobile-first design
   - Structured data for rich snippets
   - Clean internal linking architecture

5. **Scalability:**
   - Can easily add 10 more city pages (Big Spring, San Angelo, Abilene, etc.)
   - Can create industry-specific pages (healthcare IT, oil & gas IT, retail IT)
   - Can build out case studies for social proof
