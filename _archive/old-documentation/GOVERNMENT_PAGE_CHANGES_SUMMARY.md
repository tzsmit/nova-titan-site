- ❌ **REMOVED**: Misleading enterprise client statements
- ✅ **ADDED**: Clear micro-purchase eligibility messaging
- ✅ **ADDED**: Proper prime/sub delivery model explanation

---

## 🚨 CRITICAL COMPLIANCE VIOLATIONS CORRECTED

### 1. FALSE FEDERAL PAST PERFORMANCE (HIGH RISK) ✅ FIXED

#### ❌ REMOVED - Lines 519-524 (Original File)

**REMOVED CLAIMS**:
```html
<li>Dyess Air Force Base service experience</li>
<li>USDA facility technology support</li>
<li>BNSF Railway infrastructure projects</li>
<li>Government-grade security protocols</li>
<li>Clearance-capable technical staff (when needed)</li>
```

**WHY REMOVED**:
- **Dyess AFB**: Was subcontract work through Core Technology Solutions (equipment removal only), not direct federal contract. Overstated as "service experience."
- **USDA**: NO contract or subcontract exists. Completely fabricated claim.
- **BNSF Railway**: Private railway company, NOT a federal agency. Misleading association.
- **"Clearance-capable staff"**: Unverified claim. Implies active security clearances without proof.
- **"Government-grade security"**: Vague marketing language without certification backing.

**LEGAL RISK**: FAR 52.215-14 (Integrity of past performance), 18 U.S.C. § 1001 (False statements), False Claims Act implications

---

### 2. MANUFACTURING NAICS MISREPRESENTATION (HIGH RISK) ✅ FIXED

#### ❌ REMOVED - Lines 197-208 (Original File)

**REMOVED NAICS**:
```
334118 - Computer Terminal and Other Computer Peripheral Equipment Manufacturing
334290 - Other Communications Equipment Manufacturing
```

**WHY REMOVED**:
- Nova Titan does **NOT manufacture** any hardware
- Using manufacturing NAICS = false advertising
- Could disqualify from IT service contracts due to NAICS mismatch
- Descriptions were misleading ("Hardware configuration" is NOT manufacturing)

**CORRECT APPROACH**:
- Can still **bid** on these NAICS for installation/integration work
- But NEVER claim manufacturing capability
- Focus on IT services identity (541519 primary)

---

### 3. ENTERPRISE CLIENT MISREPRESENTATION (MEDIUM RISK) ✅ FIXED

#### ❌ REPLACED - Line 507 (Original File)

**OLD (Misleading)**:
```html
<li>Enterprise client experience (Amazon, Walmart, CVS)</li>
```

**NEW (Compliant)**:
```html
Work completed through national service providers for enterprise locations
including retail, logistics, and healthcare facilities
```

**WHY CHANGED**:
- OLD version implies **direct contracts** with Amazon, Walmart, CVS
- REALITY: All work completed through **intermediary providers**
- Could face legal challenges from these companies for unauthorized name use
- NEW version accurately describes the business relationship

---

### 4. UNCLEAR FEDERAL READINESS (MEDIUM RISK) ✅ FIXED

#### ❌ REPLACED - Lines 42-44 (Original File)

**OLD (Weak)**:
```html
"actively pursuing government contracting certifications"
```

**NEW (Strong)**:
```html
"SAM.gov Active, federal-ready IT services prime contractor"
"Micro-purchase ready"
"Eligible for simplified acquisition procedures"
```

**WHY CHANGED**:
- OLD version made Nova Titan sound NOT ready
- REALITY: Company IS fully registered and eligible NOW
- NEW version correctly positions immediate federal readiness

---

## ✅ MAJOR ADDITIONS & IMPROVEMENTS

### 1. PRIME/SUBCONTRACTOR DELIVERY MODEL EXPLAINED (NEW)

**Added Section**: Company Overview → Prime Contractor Delivery Model

Clearly explains:
- Nova Titan = Prime Contractor (holds the contract)
- Provides: Project Management, Quality Assurance, Oversight
- Subcontractors: Execute field work under Nova Titan's management
- Result: Nationwide coverage + compliance guarantee

**Why This Matters**:
- Differentiates from just "subcontractor"
- Shows capability to hold prime contracts
- Explains how nationwide coverage is achieved
- Demonstrates federal-ready structure

---

### 2. "HOW FEDERAL AGENCIES CAN BUY" SECTION (NEW)

**Added Complete Section**: Educational content for federal buyers

**Micro-Purchase ($10K or less)**:
- Open market purchase authority
- No competition required
- SAM.gov registration sufficient
- Nova Titan: "READY NOW"

**Simplified Acquisition ($10K-$250K)**:
- Quote-based competition
- SAM.gov + UEI + CAGE required
- Nova Titan: "FULLY ELIGIBLE"

**Prime/Sub & Teaming**:
- Prime contractor with subs
- Teaming arrangements open
- Mentor-protégé opportunities

**Why This Matters**:
- Educates federal buyers on HOW to work with Nova Titan
- Shows expertise in federal procurement process
- Makes it easy for contracting officers
- Positions for immediate opportunities

### 3. CORRECTED & CATEGORIZED NAICS CODES (RESTRUCTURED)

| Code | Description | Status |
|------|-------------|--------|
| 541519 | Other Computer Related Services | ✅ PRIMARY |
| 541512 | Computer Systems Design | ✅ Core IT |
| 541513 | Computer Facilities Management | ✅ Core IT |
| 238210 | Electrical/Wiring Installation | ✅ Core IT |
| 238990 | Specialty Trade Contractors | ✅ Core IT |
| 561621 | Security Systems Services | ✅ Core IT |
| 541611 | Management Consulting | ✅ Core IT |
| 541690 | Technical Consulting | ✅ Core IT |

#### **Optional Facilities Services NAICS** (Clearly Separated)
| Code | Description | Delivery Model |
|------|-------------|----------------|
| 561730 | Landscaping Services | Prime/Sub |
| 562111 | Solid Waste Collection | Prime/Sub |
| 561720 | Janitorial Services | Prime/Sub |
| 561210 | Facilities Support | Prime/Sub |

#### **❌ REMOVED - Manufacturing NAICS**
| Code | Description | Reason |
|------|-------------|--------|
| ~~334118~~ | ~~Computer Manufacturing~~ | Nova Titan does NOT manufacture |
| ~~334290~~ | ~~Communications Mfg~~ | Nova Titan does NOT manufacture |

**Why This Matters**:
- Clear IT identity (not diluted by facilities services)
- Manufacturing NAICS removed to avoid false claims
- Facilities services positioned as "optional" not core
- Can still bid on any NAICS (just not claiming all as primary)

---

### 4. COMPLIANT COMMERCIAL PAST PERFORMANCE (REWRITTEN)

#### **Old Version** (Lines 494-528 - Original)
- Mixed federal and commercial claims

- National retail chains
- Healthcare facilities
- Distribution & logistics centers

- Commercial office facilities

**Note Added**: "Work completed through national service providers for enterprise locations"

**Why This Matters**:
- Truthful representation of commercial work
- No false federal past performance
- Can't be challenged by named companies
- Still shows breadth of experience

---

### 5. STRENGTHENED DIFFERENTIATORS (IMPROVED)

#### **New Messaging Emphasizes**:

**Rapid Response**:

- Same-day/next-day service capability

- PM, QA, and compliance by Nova Titan
- Field execution by specialized subs

- Cost-effective delivery

**Hands-On Deployment**:
- Not just consulting
- Actual field implementation

**Federal-Ready**:
- SAM.gov Active NOW
