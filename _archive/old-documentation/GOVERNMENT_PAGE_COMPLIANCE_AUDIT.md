# 🚨 GOVERNMENT PAGE COMPLIANCE AUDIT & CORRECTION PLAN

**Date**: December 5, 2025  
**Repository**: https://github.com/tzsmit/nova-titan-site  
**Live Site**: https://novatitan.net/government/  
**Status**: ⚠️ **CRITICAL COMPLIANCE ISSUES IDENTIFIED**

---

## 🔴 CRITICAL ISSUES IDENTIFIED

### PART 1: FALSE/MISLEADING FEDERAL PAST PERFORMANCE CLAIMS

#### ❌ REMOVE IMMEDIATELY - Lines 519-524 (`government/index.html`)

```html
<li>Dyess Air Force Base service experience</li>
<li>USDA facility technology support</li>
<li>BNSF Railway infrastructure projects</li>
<li>Government-grade security protocols</li>
<li>Clearance-capable technical staff (when needed)</li>
```

**COMPLIANCE RISK**: 
- **FALSE ADVERTISING** - Implies direct federal contracts that do not exist
- **FAR 52.203-3** - Gratuities and kickbacks (misrepresentation)
- **FAR 52.215-14** - Integrity of past performance data
- **18 U.S.C. § 1001** - False statements to federal agencies

**REALITY**:
- Dyess AFB: Subcontractor work through Core Technology Solutions (equipment removal only)
- USDA: NO contract or subcontract exists
- BNSF: Private railway company (NOT federal agency)
- "Clearance-capable staff": UNVERIFIED - requires active clearances, not just capability
- "Government-grade security": Vague marketing language without certification proof

---

### PART 2: INCORRECT NAICS CODE POSITIONING

#### ❌ MANUFACTURING NAICS (Lines 197-208)

```html
334118 - Computer Terminal Manufacturing
334290 - Communications Equipment Manufacturing
```

**COMPLIANCE RISK**:
- Nova Titan does **NOT manufacture** hardware
- Using manufacturing NAICS without manufacturing capability = **False advertising**
- Could disqualify from IT service contracts due to NAICS mismatch

**CORRECT POSITIONING**:
- These should be **REMOVED** or repositioned as "Installation & Integration Services"
- Never claim manufacturing capability

---

#### ⚠️ FACILITIES NAICS (Not Listed But Should Be Separated)

Missing NAICS that should be in "Optional Service Areas":
- 561730 - Landscaping Services
- 562111 - Solid Waste Collection
- 561720 - Janitorial Services  
- 561210 - Facilities Support Services

**COMPLIANCE RISK**:
- Dilutes IT identity
- Creates confusion about core competency
- Should be clearly separated from primary IT services

---

### PART 3: ENTERPRISE CLIENT MISREPRESENTATION

#### ❌ LINE 507 - Misleading Enterprise Claims

```html
<li>Enterprise client experience (Amazon, Walmart, CVS)</li>
```

**COMPLIANCE RISK**:
- Implies **direct contracts** with Amazon, Walmart, CVS
- **REALITY**: All work completed through intermediary service providers
- Could be challenged by these enterprises for unauthorized use of their names

**CORRECT STATEMENT**:
"Work completed through national service providers for enterprise locations including retail, logistics, and healthcare facilities"

---

### PART 4: VAGUE/MISLEADING FEDERAL POSITIONING

#### ⚠️ LINES 42-44 - Unclear Federal Readiness Status

```html
"actively pursuing government contracting certifications"
```

**ISSUE**: Implies Nova Titan is NOT yet federal-ready
**REALITY**: Company IS SAM-registered, CAGE-coded, and ready for micro-purchase

**CORRECT POSITIONING**:
"Federal-ready and eligible for micro-purchase and simplified acquisition procedures"

---

## ✅ COMPLIANT POSITIONING STRATEGY

### Based on Guidance From:

**Kizzy Parks** - Niche clarity, micro-purchase ready positioning  
**Richard Howard** - Sniper-style capability statements  
**Dr. Wes Fisher** - Simple, credible, compliant messaging

---

### CORRECT BUSINESS MODEL
