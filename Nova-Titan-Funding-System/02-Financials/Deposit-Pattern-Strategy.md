## 🎯 Why Deposit Patterns Matter

### **For Business Credit (PAYDEX Score):**
- Consistent cash flow signals financial stability
- Regular deposits = ability to pay vendors on time
- Multiple smaller deposits > one large deposit (shows diversified revenue)

### **For Lenders:**
- Demonstrates predictable revenue streams
- Shows client diversity (not dependent on 1-2 customers)
- Recurring deposits (MRR) = stable, bankable income

### **For Vendors (NET-30 Terms):**
- Proves ability to pay invoices on time
- Builds trust for higher credit limits
- Opens doors to Tier 2-4 vendor accounts
